# ComPWA shared workflows

This repository hosts [shared workflows for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) and [shared actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions) that are used by [repositories of the ComPWA Project](https://github.com/orgs/ComPWA/repositories). See also [ComPWA/repo-maintenance](https://github.com/ComPWA/repo-maintenance), which enforces policies on those repositories.

Actions and shared workflows provided by this repository presume that the repository to which they are applied follow the same set-up as described on [compwa-org.rtfd.io](https://compwa-org.readthedocs.io/develop.html). For example, it assumes source code is located under the `src/` directory and documentation is located under `docs/`.
